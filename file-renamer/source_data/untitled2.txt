Subject: Updates to Marketing Strategy

Dear team,

Following our meeting on March 8, 2023, and based on recent market research, I'd like to propose the following updates to our marketing strategy for the EcoTech Smart Home System launch:

1. Influencer Partnerships:
   - We've identified 5 top-tier tech influencers with a combined reach of over 10 million followers.
   - Proposal: Allocate 20% of our marketing budget for influencer collaborations, up from the initially discussed 15%.

2. Virtual Launch Event:
   - The proposal for a virtual launch event has been approved.
   - Date set for May 10, 2023 (5 days before the official launch).
   - Will include live product demos, Q&A sessions, and exclusive pre-order opportunities.

3. Content Strategy:
   - Expanding our focus on eco-friendly aspects and cost savings.
   - New content series: "EcoTech Home Hacks" - weekly tips for maximizing energy efficiency.
   - Introducing customer testimonials from beta testers to build credibility.

4. Social Media Campaign:
   - Launch of #SmartHomeSmartPlanet hashtag campaign.
   - Increase in ad spend on Instagram and TikTok to target younger, tech-savvy homeowners.
   - Creation of AR filters for Instagram and Snapchat to virtually "place" EcoTech devices in users' homes.

5. SEO Optimization:
   - Targeting new keywords: "energy-efficient smart home", "eco-friendly home automation", "sustainable living tech".
   - Creating in-depth blog posts and whitepapers on smart home technology and sustainability.

6. Partnerships:
   - Collaborating with environmental non-profits for co-branded content and potential charity initiatives.
   - Exploring partnerships with sustainable home goods retailers for cross-promotion opportunities.

These updates aim to enhance our marketing efforts and align with the positive user testing results and product development progress discussed in our previous meeting. Please review these proposals and share any feedback or suggestions by March 25, 2023.

Our next team meeting is scheduled for March 29, 2023, where we'll finalize these strategies and discuss implementation timelines.

Best regards,
Olivia Chen
